Subject: [PATCH] Use portable-atomic for targets which lack 64-bit atomics
 used to check interpreter ID.

I chose to make the dependency mandatory instead of optional as portable-atomic
itself just forwards to the native atomics when they are available so making
that choice part of our build system is not really necessary. Personally, I was
unable to perceive any noticeable compile-time hit from adding it.
